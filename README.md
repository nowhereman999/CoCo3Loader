# CoCo3Loader
A machine code loader that let's you load and run your ML program anywhere in memory including where the BASIC loader is in memory

The zip file has everything you need to use the tool.  If you're on an x86 Mac you can use the programs as is.  If not you will have to compile the CC3SLZX0V2.3.BAS program with QB64 and you will also need the zx0 file compiled from Einar Saukas, https://github.com/einar-saukas/ZX0
